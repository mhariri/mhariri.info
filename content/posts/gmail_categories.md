#### Intro
I disabled Gmail categories a while back, and I think you should do it too.
For a long time, I have been a strict follower of the [Inbox Zero](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/290175) method. When
Gmail introduced `Gmail Categories` in 2013, I quickly jumped on it and felt
I'm even in more control of my inbox which would in turn bring me higher productivity.

 But, the productivity promise turned out wrong. After using that new service for a few years, I'm getting the same feelings
as I did before starting with that method: missing important emails, a lot of junk emails just laying in my "updates" and "promotions" categories, and occasional long time spent on email checking.

After disabling that, and archiving all the messages that jumped into my inbox from those categories, I'm again *caring* about my inbox. I got much more active in un-subscribing from the lists/websites
that I don't read. And I don't get lost in the *Updates* tab for hours. And I'm feeling I've got a part of my productivity back.

So, go on, it's easy, just [disable those categories](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2044800/disable-gmails-inbox-sorting.html) and get back your lost productivity!

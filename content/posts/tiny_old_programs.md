##### Mem game
A game of matching similar images, for one of my old favourite music bands, boyzone. Later I rewrote the program for one of my course projects to use speech recognition, see it in my course projects. Again one of my first windows programs.

##### Rainbow Shell Removing
An article on removing Rainbow hardware key shell protection by guessing a few
bytes of the target module.

##### English to Persian Dictionary
A very tiny English to Persian dictionary, I programmed it when I was switching from DOS to windows, as I needed the DOS dictionary to run under windows, so after finding out the data files structure, I write this. Somehow a very beginner coding style, as I was only 18 and this was one of my first windows programs.

##### CopyPro
Copies files even if they have bad sectors in them. Again one of my first windows programs.
[Link](copypro.exe)


##### ISPUtil Password decoder
ISPUtil uses blowfish algorithm with modified initial tables for password
encryption. This program can decrypt those passwords.

##### NLS Editor
Nls files are the files used for translation between UNICODE and ASCII
characters. This program can edit those files.
